/**
 * The interface Chromosome is provided by all chromosomes, specifying
 * genoma operations used by genetic operators during the algorithm evolution.
 * Concretizations of the Chromosome class are required to actually implement an algorithm.
 * There are some concrete chromosome types based on boolean, double, integer and object values.
 * All of these are fixed length chromosomes, as the number of genes doesn't change during
 * the algorithm iterations.
 * <p>
 * If necessary, a variable length chromosome can be implemented by subclassing
 * this abstract class and specifying the abstract methods.
 * 
 * @param <T> The type of Chromosomes accepted as input and returned by operations.
