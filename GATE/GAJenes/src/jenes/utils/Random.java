/**
 * This class provides the random generator used by JENES.
 * <p>
 * Random extends the {@link MersenneTwisterFast} class with some methods useful to JENES for obtaining values within a range.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Random implements the singleton design pattern, thus only one instance of Random is available and retrieved by invoking the method {@link #getInstance()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The random sequence is controlled by the seed. The standard seed assures that the same sequence of random values is produced by different runs. The time based seed, assures that the sequences varies run by run.
 * </p>

 * @version 1.2
 * @since 1.0
