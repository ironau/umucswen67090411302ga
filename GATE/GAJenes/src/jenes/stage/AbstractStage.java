/**
 * A generic genetic algorithm stage.<br>
 * <br>
 * In Jenes the genetic algorithm body is a "pipe" of stages:  
 * each stage processes the input population and produces the output population.<br>
 * A genetic algoritm invokes the {@link #process(Population, Population)} method of each stage. 
 * <br>
 * It is important to consider that the output population is pre-initialized with recicled individuals (for performance reasons), 
 * so {@link #process(Population, Population)} generally doesn't allocate new Individuals but only changes the genome of that in the output population.
 * The default output population size is equal to the input one, 
 * but the stage can (if needed) add or remove individuals from the output population. 
 * <br><br>
 * Note: a stage can modify the input population. So input passed to process method 
 * can be mutated when the process method ends.
 * 
 * <p>
 * @param <T> The class chromosomes flowing across the stage.
 * 
 * @version 2.0
 * @since 1.0
